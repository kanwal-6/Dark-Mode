<p>I added a dark mode feature to this project that uses local storage to remember your preference, making it easier on the eyes and more accessible for everyone! Plus, I included some extra goodies:

- A custom cursor that adds a touch of personality to the site
- A toggleable nav bar
- Filtering functionality that lets you quickly find what you're looking for
